        Our apps are free and unmolested by adds and singup gates. They always will be.
        <p> </p>
        We (someday might) track page loads or installs in the old-school, generic and anonymous zipcode way, 
        but we will never, ever, ever, ever track or sell your data.
        <p> </p>
        Why? Because the current state of the tech industry makes our blood boil.
        <p> </p>
        We are picking fights.
        <p> </p>
        Tell your friends.
        <p> </p>
        Donate if we seem worth it.
        <p> </p>
        Reach out and say hello. We are listening.

        Covid gave me this thing called executive dysfunction along with short term memory loss.
        <p> </p>
        I found myself suddenly unable to remember simple things, like did I take my life-saving pills today?
        <p> </p>
        Reminders are great. They serve a purpose.
        <p> </p>
        But mostly I just want to log what I have done, and not have alarms creaming all day.
        <p> </p>
        Cause my memory may be trash, but I am still an adult.
        <p> </p>
        Hit us up and let us know if you need improvements. If I get a few users I will take the time to make it purdy. You deserve purdy.
        <p> </p>
        Much love, humans.
